## Instructor: [Michael Soileau][instructor url]


The OWASP Top Ten is a list of the ten most critical web application security flaws that researchers have found in the wild, ranked by level of threat. This list has been compiled by security experts from all around the world.

The OWASP Top Ten is a resource that web developers use to look for known vulnerabilities, exploits and counter-measures. PHP has its own unique set of exploits, but it also has built-in functions and methods to deal with those exploits.

In this course I will demonstrate examples of the attacks in the OWASP Top Ten, and I will teach you how to harden your site and defend against each one of them.

## Source Files Description

The shell scripts needed to get up and running (Ubuntu or Debian distro only) are in the folder `bashScript`. The configuration folders for PHPLiteAdmin, PHPMyAdmin, the default Apache configuration, and so forth are under `bashScript/conf`.

The majority of the app resides in two folders: `security` and `public`. `public` is where the app views are defined. `security` contains all of the app controllers and models.
